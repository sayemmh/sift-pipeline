feature detection
what "features" should we be detecting?
localized features - keypoint features/interest points
edges
edge profiles
edges can be grouped into "curves" & "straight line segments"
analyze straight line segments to find vanishing points

2 approaches to finding feature points:
1) find features in one image that can be accurately tracked using a local search technique such as correlation or least squares

2) independently detect features in ALL the images, then match features based on their local appearance.

how can we find image locations where we can reliably find correspondences with other images?
what are good features to track?

patches with large contrast changes are easier to localize

simplest matching criterion for two image patches: weighted summed square difference.

correspondence: matching points, patches, edges, or regions, across images.

keypoint matching overview:
1) find a set of distinctive key points
2) define a region around each keypoint
3) compute a local descriptor from the normalized region
4) match local descriptors that are similar under a threshold

- try to detect points that are repeatable and distinctive

P A N O R A M A - S T I T C H I N G:
1) Identify the interest points
2) extract vector feature descriptor surrounding each interest point
3) determine correspondence between descriptors in two views

what makes a good feature?
-repeatability: same feature can be found in several images despite transformations
-saliency: each feature is distinctive
-compactness and efficiency: many fewer features than image pixels
-locality: occupies relatively small area of image

corner detection: basic idea is that a window shifted in any direction will result in a large change in intensity

Harris corner detector:

1) Compute horizontal and vertical derivatives Ix and Iy by convolving original image with derivatives of Gaussians
2) Compute three images corresponding to the outer products of these gradients
3) Convolve each of these images with a larger Gaussian
4) Compute a scalar interest measure using one of the formulas discussed above
5) Find local maxima above a certain threshold and report them as detected feature point locations
